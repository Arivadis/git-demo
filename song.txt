'Cause they watch us in sleep
And the language that we speak
And the secrets that we keep
In our dreams
In our dreams
In our dreams
In our dreams
In our dreams
In our dreams
I said I'm so sorry
To have kept you waiting around
I wish I could've come up
I could've shouted out loud
But they got exits covered
All the exits underground
I wish I could figure it out
But the world's upside down
In a world upside down
Oh, to dream this all off
In the islands of the mind
The places they can't find
We'll hide out
And the black sky came down
And the cities underground
The flowers upside down
In our dreams
Oh, to meet you again
To pass you on the stairs
To see you everywhere
In my dreams
'Cause they watch us in sleep
And the language that we speak
And the secrets that we keep to ourselves
In our dreams
In our dreams
In our dreams
In our dreams
In our dreams
I said I'm so sorry
To have kept you waiting around
I wish I could've come up
I could've shouted out loud
But they got exits covered
All the exits underground
I wish I could figure it out
But the world's upside down
I said I'm so sorry
That the world has fallen down
I wish I could do something more
I could shout it out loud
They got exits covered
All the exits underground
I wish I could figure it out
But the world's upside down
In a world upside down
Back to days of yore when we could be sure, all year, all summer
Out where you could be found, I think I found our long lost brother
We should honor the breeze instead of screaming with each other
Back to days of yore when we could be sure, all year, all summer
Out where you could be found, I think I found our long lost brother
We should honor the breeze instead of screaming with each other
Back to days of yore when we could be sure, all year, all summer
